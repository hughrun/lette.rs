# lette.rs

A CLI tool to make static site publishing less painful.

The idea of `lette.rs` is to enable you to set-and-forget your static site setup and commands, and focus on writing great blog posts.

This is basically the cleaner rustified version of [writenow](https://github.com/hughrun/writenow). Built for MacOS, probably works on n*x. Tested with Eleventy and Hugo, this is likely but not guaranteed to work with other static site generators. 

If you'd like functionality for your SSG added, or have identified a specific problem with Linux or BSD sysetms, please log an issue.

## Installation

### From executable

1. download `letters` executable from [the latest release](https://github.com/hughrun/lette.rs/releases/latest);
2. rename the file to simply `letters`;
3. Add to PATH: either:
   1. save the executable file to somewhere like `/usr/local/bin` or `/usr/bin`; or
   2. save the executable file somewhere else and symlink to somewhere on your `PATH` e.g. `sudo ln -s /FULL/PATH/TO/letters /usr/local/bin`.

### From source with cargo

```shell
cargo build --release
```

## Dependencies

`lette.rs` assumes you have `rsync` on your machine.

Unless you use `--no-image` you will also need an [API key from Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/documentation#creating-a-developer-account).

If you use `--toot` you need [a Mastodon access token](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2018/08/easy-guide-to-building-mastodon-bots/).

If you use `--tweet` you need [Twitter OAuth 1.1 credentials](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a).

## Configuration

To create or edit your configuration file, run `letters setup`.

You can see the starter configuration, including explanations, at [./src/base-config.rs](./src/base-config.rs) (this gets processed into a `.toml` file).

### Base configuration
Base configuration options are as follows:

| value                 | options             | default               | required  |
| -----                 | -------             | -------               | ----------|
| `author`              | any text string     |                       | yes       |
| `input`               | any filepath        |                       | yes       |
| `output`              | any filepath        |                       | yes       |
| `workdir`             | any filepath        |                       | yes       |
| `remote_dir`          | any filepath        |                       | yes       |
| `rss_file`            | any filepath        |                       | yes       |
| `unsplash_client_id`  | any valid token     |                       | no        |
| `server_name`         | name or IP address  |                       | yes       |
| `ssg_type`            | "eleventy", "hugo"  | "eleventy"            | no        |
| `test_url`            | any URL             | dependent on ssg_type | no        |
| `default_layout`      | any text string     | "post"                | no        |

### Filepaths

Since every user manages their files differently, and SSGs allow for a lot of flexibility, `lette.rs` needs to be told which filepaths to use.

* `input` is the directory where you would normally save your markdown files. e.g. in eleventy it might be `~/blog/input`, or in Hugo something like `~/hugo/blog/content/posts`.
* `output` is the directory where your processed files are saved. In eleventy this is probably something like `~/blog/_input` or in Hugo something like `~/hugo/blog/public`.
* `workdir` is the 'working directory' for your blog. i.e. the directory where you would normally run your SSG commands from. e.g. `~/blog` or `~/hugo`.
* `remote_dir` is the directory where your blog lives on the _server_ &mdash; that is, where your files will be synced to from your local machine. This is likely to be something like `/var/www/blog` or `/srv/blog`.
* `rss_file`is the location that your processed RSS file lives. This is used by the `--toot` and `--tweet` commands to find the title and URL of your latest post. It should be something like `~/blog/_input/rss/rss.xml` or `~/hugo/blog/public/rss/rss.xml` &mdash; note that you need to include the full file path, you can't rely on "cool URIs" because in this situation it's a filepath, not a web address.

Optionally, you can also configure options under the `commands` and `social` headings:

### Commands configuration

These values set the command that will run in a subprocess when you run the matching `letters` command. For example, the default `ssg_type` is "eleventy", so the default value for `process` is `"eleventy --input=input --quiet"`. If, for example, you use eleventy but your input directory is `/markdown`, you should set a `process` value of `"eleventy --input=markdown --quiet"`. On the other hand, if you set `ssg_type` to `"hugo"`, then the default for `process` will change to `"hugo --quiet"`, which is probably what you want. You can override these defaults by setting your own `process` value if you prefer.

| value                 | options               | default                   | required  |
| -----                 | -------               | -------                   | --------- |
| `process`             | any command           | dependent on ssg_type     | no        |
| `publish`             | any command           | "rsync -az --del --quiet" | no        |
| `test`                | any command           | dependent on ssg_type     | no        |

### Social configuration

This is where you put your API keys for posting to Twitter or Mastodon.

| value                    | options          | default             | required  |
| -----                    | -------          | -------             | ----------|
| `twitter_consumer_key`   | any valid token  |                     | no        |
| `twitter_consumer_secret`| any valid token  |                     | no        |
| `twitter_access_token`   | any valid token  |                     | no        |
| `twitter_access_secret`  | any valid token  |                     | no        |
| `mastodon_base_url`      | any valid URL    |                     | no        |
| `mastodon_access_token`  | any valid token  |                     | no        |

## Use

`lette.rs` is a command line program.

Run with `letters COMMAND [--option]`.

### commands

#### setup

This command opens your config file for viewing or editing. The config file is always saved at `~/.letters.toml` - if this file does not exist a default file will be created. If it does exist, the existing file is opened.

This is what drives `lette.rs`. Basically you put all your directory references and static site generator commands in the config file, and then you never have to remember them again.

#### write

You will be asked for some basic information, then `lette.rs` will fetch an image from Unsplash and open a new markdown file with all your frontmatter set up for you.

#### process

Once you've finished writing your masterpiece, you need to process the markdown files into html. Who can be bothered remembering the arcane command your SSG requires? Just type `letters process`!

#### test

It's always good to do a final check before publishing. Your SSG probably allows you to run your site locally. `letters test` remembers what to do, and will open your site in a browser. When you're done just head back to the command line and hit `Enter`.

#### publish

Hello world! Publishing from your local machine to a remote server is a gigantic PITA. With `lette.rs` you never have to remember how to `rsync` or whatever. Just `letters publish` and move on with your life. Don't forget to `letters process` first though, otherwise your masterpiece will languish on your local hard-drive.

### options

#### --no-image

Used with `write`, this bypasses the creation of image frontmatter. Use if you don't want images or don't want to use Unsplash.

#### --toot, -t

Used with `publish`, this will send a toot from your [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) account, with a link to your most recent post (i.e. the one you just published).

If text is provided with `--message` that will be the message text, otherwise the title of the post is used.

e.g. if your latest post is called "Rust 101" and the URL is "https://myblog.rocks/rust-101":

`letters publish --toot` will toot:

```
Rust 101
https://myblog.rocks/rust-101
```

`letters publish --toot --message 'Learning Rust is hard :rustacean:` will toot:

```
Learning Rust is hard :rustacean:
https://myblog.rocks/rust-101
```

Requires these values in your settings:
+ `mastodon_access_token`
+ `mastodon_base_url`
+ `rss_file`

#### --tweet, -w

Used with `publish`, this will send a toot from your [Twitter](https://twitter.com) account, with a link to your most recent post (i.e. the one you just published).

If text is provided with `--message` that will be the message text, otherwise the title of the post is used.

e.g. if your latest post is called "101 ways with broccoli" and the URL is "https://myblog.rocks/101-ways-with-broccoli":

`letters publish --tweet` will tweet:

```
101 ways with broccoli
https://myblog.rocks/101-ways-with-broccoli
```

`letters publish --tweet --message 'I love broccoli` will tweet:

```
I love broccoli
https://myblog.rocks/101-ways-with-broccoli
```

Requires these values in your settings:
+ `twitter_consumer_key`
+ `twitter_consumer_secret`
+ `twitter_access_token`
+ `twitter_access_secret`
+ `rss_file`

#### --message

Use with `--toot` or `--tweet` as described above.

You can also use the short form of these commands and/or combine them:

```
letters publish -tw -m 'Check out my latest blog post'
```
